# What is ION? 
The NASA‚Äôs Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) is an implementation of Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN). 

DTN is a digital communication networking technology that enables data to be conveyed reliably among communicating entities when roundtrip times may be highly variable
and/or very long. Data transmission is done automatically and reliably even if one or more of the network links in the end-to-end path between those entities is subject to very long signal 
propagation latency and/or prolonged intervals of unavailability.

ION DTN is suitable to both planetary and interplanetary environments succeptible to communication delay and disruption.

## Quick Start

**1. Linux, OS/X or Solaris**
	To build and install the entire ION system on a `Linux, OS/X, or Solaris
platform`, cd into ion-open-source and enter three commands:

````
$ ./configure (If configure is not present run: "autoreconf -fi" first)
$ make
$ sudo make install
````
`NOTE`: if you want to set overriding compile-time switches for a build, 
the place to do this is in the ./configure command.  For details,

````
$ ./configure -h
````

**2. Android**

	To build ION for `Android`, cd into ion-open-source/arch-android and see the instructions in the `README.bionic` text file.

**3. RTEMS**

	To build ION for `RTEMS`, cd into ion-open-source/arch-rtems and see the instructions in the README text file.

**4. Windows** 

	To build ION for `Windows`, see the instructions in the "Building ION from source on Windows.pdf" document.

**5. ARM-based AT91SAM9G20 board**

	To build ION for the `ARM-based AT91SAM9G20 board`, cd into ion-open-source/arch-uClibc and see the instructions in the "ARM build.pdf" file. 

**6. Build individual ION packages**

	It's also possible to build the individual packages of ION, using platform-specific Makefiles in the package subdirectories.  If you choose this option, be aware of the dependencies among the packages:

* The `ici` package must be built (`make` and `make install`) before any other package.

* The `bp` package is dependent on `dgr` and "ltp" and `bssp` as well as `ici`.
  		
* The `cfdp`, `ams`, `bss`, and `dtpc` packages are dependent on `bp`.

* The `restart` package is dependent on `cfdp`, `bp`, `ltp`, and `ici`.

Also, be aware that these Makefiles install everything into subdirectories
of /usr/local.  To override this behavior, change the value of OPT in the
top-level Makefile of each package.

Additional details are provided in the README.txt files in the root
directories of some of the subsystems.

Note that all Makefiles are for gmake; on a freebsd platform, be sure
to install gmake before trying to build ION.
